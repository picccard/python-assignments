The other two textfiles had line breakes all over them. This made it harder to deside what is a paragraph and what is not! This new file is more like a real doc or docx file where each paragraph is ended with a new line character.
Therefore will this become the second paragraph and the count will start all over again. Now all that is left is to use this file.
This makes the function easy to brake because it relies on a spesific structure of the file in order to work. This cant always be guaranteed!
But its better to have something that works in order to show the consept of the code?
The last paragraph in a document is often just ended with one of these (dot, exclamation mark, question mark) this results in the last paragraph not counting as a paragraph because its missing an new line char at the end.Just for this demonstration, i have added a new line at the end of every paragraph.
